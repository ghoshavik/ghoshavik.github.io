          <h3>About Myself</h3><hr>

            <p>I am a guy who is pretty passionate about writing, I started off with creative writing, then got introduced to professional stuff. My niche of writings are, <b>Performing Arts</b> and <b>Upcoming technologies</b>. <br>I write in English primarily and in my mother tongue(Bengali) secondarily. I prefer both the language to employ my creative faculties. I have worked for <a href='http://yourstory.com' target='_blank'><b>Yourstory.com</b></a> for a little period of time, as a guest writer. I dont believe in self praising or boasting about myself, so I won't say that I would be a good or the best guy to get fit in the kind of organisation you run, You gotta check me out before gauging , me properly. <br>I am working on a novel, which gonna be a personal monologue, albeit its in a very nascent stage, I look forward to get it completed and share it with you people.I also have got a keen interest in open source and the stuff related to it. Apart from that I am into social work and music as well. <br>I try to play my guitar in the meanwhile, and I try to sing as well, some known tracks and quite a few originals.. I love to teach little kids, and have a group named Ankurit, we give education to underpriviledge kids and help them with all sort of things that they need to be a good human being. Anyway, I am quite focused on the present and future of my writings... . :)</p>
